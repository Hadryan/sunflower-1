## Goal of this project

I tried to implement audio analysis scripts in web contexts by retrieving sounds directly from queries (in bytes). My goal is to automate the processing of these sounds.

## How to use it in a Jupyter Notebook

Inside your venv, run these commands:

```
pip install ipykernel
ipython kernel install --user --myKernel
```
